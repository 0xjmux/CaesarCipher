# CaesarCipher
Encryption and Decryption programs for a Caesar Cipher written in python
<br>
I used Python 3 for this program. It's pretty self explanatory. Run the program, enter the text to encrypt/decrypt, and then enter the shift. The program will spit out the encrypted/decrypted text. I've verified it works.

This was a fun project I made in an afternoon. The code is a bit of a mess, but after all, I'm still learning Python.
